# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

Implemented a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Used python's Tkinter library for the implementation.

Created a Tic Tac Toe Game with a Tkinter GUI. This GUI has Player 1 Score, Player 2 Score, New Game and Reset Game option. Winner recieves a pop up congradulating them on winning the game.

The reference for this project was taken from an online course I had taken for python on Udemy and also from a youtube video by DJ Oamen.
